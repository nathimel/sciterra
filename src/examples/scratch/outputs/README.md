## Log


Note: I made the mistake of not reversing the np.sort and np.argsort results on cosine similarity matrices, for all code up until July 25. This means that topographic metrics were incorrect (nbd), and the expansion logic was inverted -- we were searching for publications _furthest_ from the center (a bigger deal).
