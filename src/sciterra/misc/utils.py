    ## API_extension::get_data_via_api
    ## This decorator is general, except for the default allowed exception.

    Args:
        n_attempts (int):
            Number of attempts before letting the exception happen.

        allowed_exceptions (tuple of class):
            Allowed exception class. Set to BaseException to keep trying regardless of exception.

        sleep_after_attempt (int):
            Number of seconds to wait before trying each additional attempt.

        verbose (bool):
            If True, be talkative.

    Example Usage:
        > @keep_trying( n_attempts=4 )
        > def try_to_call_web_api():
        >     " do stuff "
